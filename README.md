# Predicting-Graduate-Admissions
In this project I will be predicting "Chance of Admit" for different grad school applicants. The work flow consists of Data Processing, Linear regression and Multiple linear regression models. We use these different regression to see which best fits our model and is able to give the most accurate results. I also use visualization methods to produce box plots, violin plots, heat maps and pair plots to best communicate the findings.

This dataset is created for prediction of Graduate Admissions from an Indian perspective.

Content
The dataset contains several parameters which are considered important during the application for Masters Programs.
The parameters included are :

GRE Scores ( out of 340 
TOEFL Scores ( out of 120 )
University Rating ( out of 5 )
Statement of Purpose and Letter of Recommendation Strength ( out of 5 )
Undergraduate GPA ( out of 10 )
Research Experience ( either 0 or 1 )
Chance of Admit ( ranging from 0 to 1 )

Acknowledgements
This dataset is inspired by the UCLA Graduate Dataset. The test scores and GPA are in the older format.
The dataset is owned by Mohan S Acharya.
